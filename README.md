Outlook add-in to connect a modern workplace to make its people more productive, and happier by facilitating new relationships across organizations in a natural way. 
Nobody says: “I wish I knew less people at my company”. We know it’s important to network and we know it helps us be more productive, but it’s hard to “just meet” people. Technology has enabled teams to grow larger and further apart by a virtue of video conferencing and real time collaboration tools. This however, has introduced a modern problem into our workplace. A feeling of separation and disconnect from each other. In a company of hundreds or thousands of people we know our immediate team and maybe someone who sits on our floor, yet our work spans across many teams who aren’t next to us. We’re expected to just walk into meetings with strangers and be productive. That’s anxiety inducing and productivity diminishing environment. We think we can change that.
